# Neural-Network-for-Binary-Classification
this code illustrates how to do Binary Classification using Neural Network and then Feature selection and redo it again to enhance your output

this code apply to Sequential Feature Selection
A common method of Feature Selection is sequential feature selection. This method has two components:

An objective function, called the criterion, which the method seeks to minimize over all feasible feature subsets. Common criteria are mean squared error (for regression models) and misclassification rate (for classification models).

A sequential search algorithm, which adds or removes features from a candidate subset while evaluating the criterion. Since an exhaustive comparison of the criterion value at all 2n subsets of an n-feature data set is typically infeasible (depending on the size of n and the cost of objective calls), sequential searches move in only one direction, always growing or always shrinking the candidate set.
